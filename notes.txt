-------HANDLE PLAYER DEATH STUPID

-background
✔randomize crystal locations/fix crystal and enemy spawning
✔autonomous summon separate from player
-choose between different summons with different properties, could maybe keep riding summon with a limit?
    ✔summon select menu
    -push enemies away when summoning, bigger summon visual
    -summon descriptions when you highlight each button
-more summons
    ✔rework chompy to live on his own: chomp around being a good attack monster
    -Ivan: eyeball that shoots a laser that goes fullscreen (weakness: either limited damage or crowd control)
        -just need that extra dmg, parameterize dealing damage to enemies, give them health
    -Gorg: charges straight into enemies, knocking them around if they don't die
    -Simon: grabs one enemy at a time, draining their life and giving it to you (weakness, doesn't kill efficiently, heals slowly)
        -deal 0.25dmg every 0.5s, send health to player
        -grab enemy and hold them in place while sapping (too much? OP? would make high-health enemies trivial, maybe limit grab time)
    -Smog: a cloud of smoke that slows down enemies within, making them easier to avoid and hit
    -stretch goal: ultimate summon that sacrifices your other ones or requires each to be summoned at least once
-enemy2: move only in cardinal directions
-enemy3: DVD logo
-some enemy needs more health to make chompy not as braindead, give Ivan more of a purpose with his upcoming extra damage
-possibly use space to summon at will rather than requiring the player to summon immediately when grabbing a crystal (might not be needed with pushback effect?)
-require more crystals to summon once you have a few so that you can't spam as much
-spawn more enemies and tougher enemies so that summons don't instantly overrun the game lmao

✔do something about enemy1 getting stuck in corner - bigger play area feels better, working from there
-fix menu button sizing
✔concept going forward: enemy waves come with time, new waves do not wait for you to finish the previous ones
-maybe different font that better matches occult-ish theme?
