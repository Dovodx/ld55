    -rework chompy to live on his own: chomp around being a good attack monster
    -Ivan: eyeball that shoots a laser that goes fullscreen (weakness: either limited damage or crowd control)
    -Gorg: charges straight into enemies, knocking them around if they don't die
    -Simon: grabs one enemy at a time, draining their life and giving it to you (weakness, doesn't kill efficiently, heals slowly)
    -Smog: a cloud of smoke that slows down enemies within, making them easier to avoid and hit
    -stretch goal: ultimate summon that sacrifices your other ones or requires each to be summoned at least once
-enemy2: move only in cardinal directions
-enemy3: DVD logo
✔do something about enemy1 getting stuck in corner - bigger play area feels better, working from there
-fix menu button sizing
-concept going forward: enemy waves come with time, new waves do not wait for you to finish the previous ones
