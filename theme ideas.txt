final round themes:
Summoning: run through a hostile environment where you can't attack, collecting summoning crystals so that you can summon a giant beast to go on a rampage
It spreads: attack of the butter knife and/or smokebomb party
Recycle: recycle dead enemies into something useful
Tunnels: SHADOW THE HEDGEHOG SLIME TUNNELS
Strange machines: you play as a robot that can attach wacky objects to yourself for goof-like purposes
Single use: bombs? bombs have a single use
Strength in numbers: use numbers of increasing size as weapons to defeat bunches of enemies
Fishing: YOU get fished "THE HOOKS!"
Push your luck: approach a dangerous limit of something, see how close you can get without dying or similar
Digging: could use the "bring out of light or hiding" def. to twist the meaning
Cartography: use a special map that reveals hidden secrets? or miss the point on purpose
Pick your poison: start off strong and choose between different debuff poisons in order to progress
Decay: your character (health?) decays and must be maintained, encourage player to take action
Collapse: navigate falling structure like cosmic fall from shadow the hedgehog
Mutation: ace combat but you can mutate your plane in unusual ways, like longer wings, under/oversized parts, impossible maneuvers
You don't play as the main character: release enemies to stop the hero before eventually facing them as the final boss

general concepts and their practicality:
ace combat: [eh maybe not] movement, missiles, and interp should be no problem, question of player models, enemies, and environment design and how much of a timesink that would be on top of the upgrade/mutation concept
fps: I'd prefer another genre, since I did this last time; however, a first-person game doesn't have to be a shooter primarily
platformer: very versatile, could work for just about any theme, maybe the most managable scope?
tower defense/stop the hero: not as directly interactive for the player, but for certain themes I think it's a good fit
fighting game: would have to be simple or it'd be highly impractical, movement & combat mechanics could be time consuming; could be interesting as a "summon only" fighting game, if that's the theme
