FG MVP: too much, scale WAYYYY back
-one character that can move
-at least a dummy opponent, always face opponent
-basic char sprite
-camera config, pan around stage
-high, low, and mid hitboxes & blocking
-interpolation
    âœ”player character
    -summons
    -projectiles
-hitboxes and simple hurtboxes (stand, crouch)
-light, medium, heavy buttons - simple normals? or just have each button be a summon
-health bars, super meter? some kind of resource to limit summoning (could be health)
-3 basic summon types that can be tweaked for different characters
-sound effects
    -summoning sounds
    -block
    -hit (maybe different types)
    -death
    -voice over? FIGHT
    -character name calls?
-simple stage with corner limits
-match timer
-basic AI that summons things at you and attempts to block
-at least 1 song
-input remapping
-input guide for default controls at least
-controller support
-possibly do motion inputs?

Extended ideas:
-3 characters with summons of different properties
-at least 3 different stages with their own music tracks
-super meter and super summons, use motion input probably 22X
-unblockable detection/protection
